#Munenori: An ADN Direct Message Application for Mac OS X#

This app was developed by Aaron Vegh for the [Objective-C Hackathon](http://objectivechackathon.appspot.com). Go Objective-C! 

It's a fun project to see what's involved in interacting with the App Dot Net API. It's fantastic, as it happens. This implementation is the result of about 6 hours of work, so it's rough. Real rough.
